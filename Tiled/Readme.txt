Banned lands use "Tiled" (http://www.mapeditor.org/) as the map editor.

The "converter.js" tool is a bridge between the data generated by Tiled and the engine itself.
To run the tool execute "node converter.js path/to/file.json".
For the maps to work in the engine, it is mandatory to put two special attributes in the maps:
- zindex: the render layer index
- tileset: the number of the tileset in the client texture tables

Also, if a collision layer is needed, it should be called "CollisionLayer", and only one different tile should be put (so the engine take it as a 1).
